This theorem is important because it allows us to make inferences about a population based on a sample, even when the sample size is large."

    "## Confidence Interval\n",
    "\n",
    "A confidence interval is a statistical concept that provides a range of values within which an unknown population parameter is likely to fall. It is used to estimate the uncertainty or variability of a population parameter, such as the mean, proportion, or difference between two means.\n",
    "\n",
    "The confidence interval is calculated based on a sample from the population and is used to make inferences about the population parameter. The confidence level, often denoted by \"1 - α\" or \"100(1 - α)%\", represents the probability that the true population parameter falls within the confidence interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple example to illustrate the concept of a confidence interval:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you have a sample of 100 students' heights, and you want to estimate the average height of all students in the population. You calculate the sample mean and find that it is 175 cm. To determine the confidence interval, you would use a t-distribution or a normal distribution, depending on the sample size and the assumptions made about the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume you use a t-distribution and choose a confidence level of 95% (α = 0.05). You would then calculate the margin of error, which is the range within which the true population parameter is likely to fall. In this case, the margin of error would be approximately 2 cm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The confidence interval would then be calculated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lower limit = Sample mean - Margin of error\n",
    "Upper limit = Sample mean + Margin of error\n",
    "\n",
    "Lower limit = 175 cm - 2 cm = 173 cm\n",
    "Upper limit = 175 cm + 2 cm = 177 cm\n",
    "\n",
    "So, with a 95% confidence level, you would estimate that the average height of all students in the population is likely to be between 173 cm and 177 cm.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, a confidence interval provides a range of values within which an unknown population parameter is likely to fall, based on a sample from the population. The confidence level represents the probability that the true population parameter falls within the confidence interval. Confidence intervals are used to make inferences about population parameters and to estimate their uncertainty or variability."
