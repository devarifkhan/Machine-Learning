    "## Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning (ML), hypothesis testing is used to evaluate the performance of predictive models and make informed decisions about their reliability. The process involves formulating a null hypothesis (H0) and an alternative hypothesis (H1), which are statements about the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The null hypothesis typically assumes that the model's performance is not significantly different from a baseline or a specific value. The alternative hypothesis proposes that the model's performance is significantly better or worse than the baseline or the specific value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis testing in ML can be applied to various aspects, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Model comparison: Comparing the performance of different ML models to determine which one is more accurate or efficient.\n",
    "2. Feature selection: Evaluating the importance of features in a model by testing whether their inclusion significantly improves the model's performance.\n",
    "3. Hyperparameter tuning: Testing different hyperparameter values to determine which combination yields the best model performance.\n",
    "4. Model validation: Evaluating the model's performance on unseen data to assess its generalization ability.\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform hypothesis testing in ML, the following steps are typically followed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define the null hypothesis (H0) and the alternative hypothesis (H1).\n",
    "2. Choose a statistical test, such as the t-test, chi-square test, or F-test, depending on the nature of the data and the research question.\n",
    "3. Calculate the test statistic and determine the p-value, which represents the probability of observing a test statistic as extreme or more extreme than the one obtained, assuming the null hypothesis is true.\n",
    "4. Compare the p-value to the significance level (commonly set at 0.05) to determine whether to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "5. Interpret the results and draw conclusions about the model's performance based on the hypothesis test.\n",

    "## Null and alternative hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of the previous example, the null and alternative hypotheses would be defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Null Hypothesis (H0): The logistic regression model and the decision tree classifier have the same accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The logistic regression model and the decision tree classifier have different accuracies.\n",
    "\n",
    "By comparing the accuracies of the two models on the testing set, we can calculate the p-value using a t-test (assuming the data is normally distributed and the variances are equal). If the p-value is less than the significance level (commonly set at 0.05), we reject the null hypothesis and support the alternative hypothesis. This means that we can conclude that the logistic regression model and the decision tree classifier have different accuracies.\n",

    "Example 2: Testing the significance of a feature in a regression model\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we select a specific feature (e.g., the number of rooms) and perform a F-test to evaluate its significance in the linear regression model. The F-value represents the ratio of the variance explained by the feature to the variance unexplained by the feature. The p-value represents the probability of observing an F-value as extreme or more extreme than the one obtained, assuming that the feature is not significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the p-value is less than the significance level (commonly set at 0.05), we reject the null hypothesis that the feature is not significant. This means that we can conclude that the feature is statistically significant in the linear regression model.\n",
